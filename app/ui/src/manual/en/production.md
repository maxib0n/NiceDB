# Production safety

A connection whose environment is **production** opens read-only. To write you unlock writes, every write asks for confirmation, and every write goes into the log. The rules are set in **Settings › Safety**.

## Mark a connection as production
1. Right-click the connection › **Edit…**.
2. In **Environment** choose **production**.
3. **Save**.

If the host is not on this computer (not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1`), “This server is not on your computer” appears under **Environment** with a **Mark as production** button. With an SSH tunnel the bastion is what counts: a database on `localhost` reached through a remote server is remote. The environment changes only with the button, never by itself; file connections (SQLite, DuckDB) and local hosts show no hint.

From then on:
- when the active tab is on that connection, the title bar shows a strip with the **production** stamp and the connection name;
- its tabs get an edge and a tint in the production colour, even when they are not the active one;
- the **Read** / **Write** switch appears in the row below the tabs;
- the production time limit applies (see below).

The other environments (**local**, **development**, **staging**) are not locked; they only change the time limit.

## Take a connection out of production
Changing the environment from **production** to another one turns the protection off, in the sessions already open too. Saving therefore asks for the same confirmation as a write, in the “Take this connection out of production?” dialog: with **Type the name** you type the name the connection had before. The change goes into the write log (“-- environment production -> local”).

An import that replaces a production connection keeps it in production.

## Read-only
While writes are closed the switch reads **Read-only**.
- Reads run as usual: `SELECT`, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN`, the read-only commands of MongoDB and Redis.
- A write is refused with “Production is read-only: unlock writes to run this.”.
- Where the engine allows it, the session is read-only on the server too: a write hidden inside a function is stopped by the server itself. This holds on PostgreSQL and compatibles, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Firebird (read-only transactions), ClickHouse (`readonly=2` on every request) and Oracle (statements that are not queries, outside an open transaction, run in a read-only transaction). SQL Server, DuckDB, SAP HANA, Db2, Cassandra, DynamoDB and OpenSearch rely on NiceDB recognising writes.
- It covers everything that writes: editor, Data view, table designer, import, MongoDB documents, Redis keys, “Cancel query” in Tools › Activity.
- Tools › Test data never writes to a production connection.

## Unlock writes
1. In the row below the tabs, click the switch.
2. The popup says how long writes stay open and which confirmation every write will ask for.
3. **Unlock writes**.

- With timed unlocking the time left runs next to the switch: “9:42 left”. At zero writes lock again by themselves.
- If time runs out while a statement is running, the statement finishes (“time is up: locks when the statement ends”) and then writes lock.
- Unlocking holds for the session: every tab on the same connection and database can write. Each one shows it on its tab, with the open lock and the time left, even when it is not the active tab.
- Clicking the open switch locks at once (**Lock now**), in every tab of the session.
- [[Esc]] or a click outside closes the popup without unlocking.
- After a reconnect the session starts read-only again: unlock again.
- **Import data** on a production connection shows the switch in its own dialog too.

## Choose how unlocking works
**Settings › Safety › Unlocking writes**:

| Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Timed** | writes stay open for the **Production unlock time** (2, 5, 10, 30 or 60 minutes; 10 by default), then lock |
| **Until disconnect** | writes stay open until you close the connection, with no countdown |
| **Always open** | production is never read-only; “Writes always open” replaces the switch |

The **production** stamp stays visible in every mode, and the confirmations stay as chosen below.

Moving to a looser mode (here or in **Confirm before writing**) asks for confirmation in the “Loosen production safety?” dialog and goes into the log of every production connection.

## Confirm a write
**Settings › Safety › Confirm before writing**:

| Mode | What it asks |
|---|---|
| **Type the name** (default) | for every write you type the connection name; the button turns on only when the name matches |
| **Confirmation dialog** | a dialog with **Cancel** and **Confirm**; focus starts on **Cancel** |
| **None** | writes go straight through; only the log remains |

The confirmation dialog shows:
- the title, for example “Run on production?” or “Apply 3 changes to production?”, and the connection name;
- the statements or changes about to run;
- for risky statements, the rows they will touch (“touches 1,240 rows”) when they can be estimated;
- a warning if someone changed the rows you are about to edit in the meantime.

[[Esc]] is the same as **Cancel**. To try a write without committing it, use a dry run: see [Transactions and dry run](transactions).

## Risky statements
They ask for confirmation outside production too, with the “Run risky statements?” dialog and the **Run anyway** button:
- `UPDATE` or `DELETE` without `WHERE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`;
- MongoDB: `delete` or `update` on every document, `drop`, `dropDatabase`, `dropIndexes`, `collMod`, `renameCollection`;
- Redis: `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, `KEYS`, `CONFIG SET`, `SHUTDOWN`, `CLIENT KILL` and the like;
- ClickHouse: `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER` including mutations.

On production they follow the chosen confirmation mode: with **None** they run without asking.

## Time limits
**Settings › Safety** has a **Time limit** for each environment. A query that runs past it is cancelled on the server with “Stopped after 60 s: the environment's time limit.”.

| Environment | Default |
|---|---|
| local | No limit |
| development | No limit |
| staging | 5 min |
| production | 1 min |

Choices: No limit, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 h.

## Write log
NiceDB keeps this log on your computer: it holds only the writes NiceDB sent. Writes made with other tools (psql, another client, an application) do not appear here. To see everything that reaches the database, use the database's own audit, for example pgaudit on PostgreSQL.

Every write NiceDB makes, on any connection, is recorded: when, system user, database, rows touched, the text sent and any error. It covers the editor, Data view (a filter that writes too), documents, keys, the `COMMIT` of a transaction that wrote, cancelled server sessions and restores. On production, unlocking and locking writes, changing the environment and loosening the safety settings are recorded as well.

Passwords written in SQL (`PASSWORD '…'`, `IDENTIFIED BY …`, Redis `AUTH`, MongoDB `pwd` and the like) become `***` in both the log and the history.

1. Open a table in the **Data** view.
2. In its header, **Log**.
3. To save it: **Export** › **CSV table** or **JSON file**.

The panel shows the connection's last 200 writes; the export holds all of them.

### Put the old values back
Changes applied from the **Data** view have **Revert…**: NiceDB remembers the values the rows had and prepares the inverse statements (an edit puts the old value back, a deleted row returns, an added row goes away), shows them in the confirmation window and runs them in one transaction, with the same unlock and confirmation as any write. Each statement must touch exactly one row: if a row has changed since, the revert stops and touches nothing. The revert goes into the log too and can be reverted in turn.

Other writes are marked **cannot be reverted**: SQL written in the editor, imports, documents, keys and tool commands do not keep the old values. A row added with a key the database generated is found again by the values written: if more than one matches, the revert stops.

## Limitations
- With manual commit, unlocking writes closes an open transaction that has not written yet: it was started read-only.
- The log lives on this computer, in NiceDB's local database: it is not a server audit trail and does not see writes made by other tools.
- The recorded user is the operating system user, not the database user.
